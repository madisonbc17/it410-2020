# Mrs. Robertson's Class Website
In August 2019, my sister-in-law was complaining about the lack of customization Wix permits. She teaches history to middle schoolers who are very tech savvy. Although she wishes to tailor her teaching to her students, her classroom resources are limited.
In response, I have created a website that she could use and host in Cloud environments. I am still working on the final product and am hoping to have this website ready by Fall 2020.

In addition to helping out family, this became my final project for an advanced web technology course I took my senior year of college.
The main concepts we learned and applied include:
- Domain Driven Design
- Git
- REST APIs
- JavaScript Fundamentals
- NodeJS and NPM
- Express middleware
- Testing in NodeJS
- Asynchronous Events in JavaScript
- Docker
- SQL and NoSQL databases
- Session Management
- HTML and CSS
- Browser Events
- Vue
- Nuxt

## System Requirements
In order to run this website, Docker must be installed and running.

## Running the Website
Use the following commands to run the website:

`docker-compose build`

`docker-compose up`

## Viewing the Website
After running the docker-compose commands, the website will be running on localhost:2020. 

To change the port it's running on, go to the .env file and change the SERVER_PORT variable.
